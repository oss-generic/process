= Reviewing PRs
:sectnums:

A typical PR is reviewed by,

* [x] one _**main reviewer**_: Usually, a lead member. Reviews _all_ aspects of the PR, including code quality.
* [x] one _**code quality reviewer**_: Usually, the Project Manager. Can be delegated to a Project Mentor.
Performs a final check on the quality of the PR.
* [ ] [Optional] _**supplementary reviewers**_: Core members can be used as additional reviewers if the PR involves
multiple areas.

[TIP]
====
Junior members can get other junior members to act as _**peer reviewers**_ for their PRs before submitting
to the project's formal review process.

== Review procedure

=== Before you begin

Ensure the following at the start of the review. If any of them are missing, ask the dev to fix.

* [x] PR name follows the <<FormatsAndConventions.adoc#pr,PR title convention>>.
* [x] PR description has the correct `Fixes #...` reference.
* [x] The CI build is successful or any failures are justifiable (e.g. false positives from static analysis tools).
* [x] PR branch name follows the <<FormatsAndConventions.adoc#branch,branch naming convention>>.
** This is a soft requirement. Encourage the dev to follow the convention in future PRs.
* [x] Meets our <<FormatsAndConventions.adoc#commit-organization,requirements for commit organization>>.
* [x] Commit summary has been generated using CanIHasReview.

[TIP]
====
These two requirements are automatically guaranteed by CanIHasReview:

* [x] The branch is up to date with the `master` branch at the time of the review request.
* [x] The branch does not contain merge commits.
====

Additional guidelines for `d.FirstTimers` issues:

* Ensure the dev has not done any other `d.FirstTimers` issues. If he has, inform the dev and close the PR.
* If the branch contains multiple commits, ask the dev to squash into one commit (unless the commits are
'well-organized' already).
* If the commit message is far from our quality expectations even after 1-2 attempts to improve it by the dev,
you can propose a revised commit message for the dev to use.

=== Review the PR and add comments

* Use GitHub's review feature to add comments.
** Use `start a review` option when adding comments on the latest version of a PR diff.
** Use the `add single comment` when responding to an existing thread of discussion in a PR diff.
* Review big PRs incrementally (i.e. one commit at a time), starting with the earliest commit.

[NOTE,caption=Rationale]
====
If the early commits require lot of changes, there's no need to review later commits until the
early commits are updated as per review.
====

* As you review the code, ensure the following:
** [x] The solution is the best possible solution to the problem under the circumstances.
** [x] *All five aspects* of a code change are done:
*** [x] *Code*
*** [x] *Comments* e.g. header comments
*** [x] *Tests*: Almost all code changes to functional code should have changes to test code
*** [x] *User docs* e.g. help pages
*** [x] *Dev docs* e.g. design diagrams
** [x] Coding style and best practices are followed (some of these are not detected by static analysis tools).
** [x] The PR does not contain unrelated changes.
e.g. unnecessary formatting changes or commits from other branches.
** [x] All your previous review comments have been addressed.
** [x] Commit messages follow <<FormatsAndConventions.adoc#commit-messages,our requirements>>.

=== Approve or request changes at the end of the review

* If changes are needed, choose `Request changes`.
* Else, choose `Approve`.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use `Approve` unless you are fully satisfied with the current state of the PR.
i.e. NOT allowed: `Let me approve this first while you fix the remaining minor problems`.
====

=== Update the PR status

If you are the last reviewer to review the current iteration (i.e. no more pending reviews for the
current iteration), change the status label as follows:

* If any of the reviewers have requested changes, change the status label to `s.Ongoing`.
* Else, change status to `s.ToMerge`.
