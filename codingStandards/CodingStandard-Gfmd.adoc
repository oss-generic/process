= GitHub Flavored Markdown Coding Standard

* The term 'markdown' in this document refers to __GitHub Flavored Markdown__.
* Follow the syntax as specifed https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[here].

== Follow strict GFMD syntax to be compatible with GitHub Pages

Minor deviations from the markdown syntax are sometimes forgiven by GitHub markdown rendering but may not be forgiven
by https://github.com/blog/2289-publishing-with-github-pages-now-as-easy-as-1-2-3[GitHub Pages html rendering].

* Add a blank line at the beginning of a list.

```markdown
Here is a list:

* item 1
* item 2
```

`markdown   Here is a list:   * item 1   * item 2`

* Similar to above point, add a blank line at the beginning of a code block.
* Add space at the start of a heading.

`markdown   # Heading`

`markdown   #Heading`

* Use blockquote symbol in every line of the blockquote.

`markdown   > first line   > second line`
image:Bad.png[image]

`markdown   > first line     second line`

== Use blank lines to separate headings

== Use blockquotes for additional info

Blockquotes are usually used for additional info the reader can skip over.

[source,markdown]
----
> Some additional info.
----

== Use generic numbering for ordered list

Using `1.` for every item in an ordered list can make it easy to insert more items later.

[TIP]
====
Generic numbers are converted to the correct numbers by GitHub markdown renderer.
