== Use blockquotes for additional info

Blockquotes are usually used for additional info the reader can skip over.

[source,markdown]
----
> Some additional info.

== Use generic numbering for ordered list

Using `1.` for every item in an ordered list can make it easy to insert more items later.

Generic numbers are converted to the correct numbers by GitHub markdown renderer.
