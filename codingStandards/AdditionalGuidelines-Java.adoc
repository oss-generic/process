= Additional Guidelines - Java

== Using assertions

Refer to the article
_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html[Programming With Assertions]_
(from Oracle) for more details on the three general guidelines below.

. **Do not use assertions to do any work that your application requires for correct operation.**
If you do, the code will not work as expected when assertions are turned off.
.  **Do not use assertions for checking _preconditions_/parameters in public methods.**
Those should be enforced by explicit checks that throw particular,
specified exceptions. e.g. `IllegalArgumentException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, or `NullPointerException`.
. *Assertions may be used to check _postconditions_ and class/method _invariants_ in both public
and nonpublic methods.*

In addition,

* *Do not handle 'impossible' exceptions using assertions*.
Instead of handling 'impossible' exceptions using an `assert false` as given below,
throw a runtime error such as an `AssertionError`.

`java    ...    } catch (Exception e) {        assert false : "This exception should not happen";    }`

image:Good.png[image]
`java    ...    } catch (Exception e) {        throw new AssertionError("This exception should not happen");    }`

[NOTE,caption=Rationale]
====
As the program flow has already triggered an exception, switching to assertions is not necessary when
another exception can handle it just as well.
