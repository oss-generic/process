[[choosing-issues]]
== Choosing issues

* Follow issue priorities. Prefer to take higher priority issues over lower priority issues.
* Favor issues related to certain features/aspects/techs to deepen expertise in those areas.

== Updating a PR in response to a review

* Favor the <<HowToGuides.adoc#create-a-multi-step-pr,multi-step PR approach>> even for smaller PRs which has only one
logical step.
* If the `master` has progressed beyond the root of the PR branch, rebase the PR branch
(instead of merging `master` to PR branch). This will keep the PR branch free of merge commits.
