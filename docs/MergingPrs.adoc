[[who-can-merge]]
== Who can merge

A PR is to be merged by the author of the PR if the author has commit privileges.
Else it should be merged by the main reviewer.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
PRs that can be merged without any further testing and post-merge clean up can be merged by the
_code quality reviewer_.

== When to merge

Merging to `master` or `release` branches requires approval from both _main reviewer_ and the _code quality reviewer_.

[[how-to-merge]]
== How to merge

. Make sure that GitHub gives the green light for merging. In the cases given below, the author should resolve
the problem as described and submit a new iteration.
. *Merge conflict*: The PR is conflicting with the current `master` branch. The author should rebase the branch
and resolve conflicts.
. *Check failure*: E.g. CI is failing. The author should fix the causes of the failures or give acceptable
justifications for the failures.
. *Outdated branch*: The PR is not in sync with the current `master` branch. The author should rebase the branch.
Do not use GitHub's 'Update branch' button because it will create a merge commit instead of rebasing.
Alternatively, the person merging can trigger the CI checks to run again if he has access to the CI server.
If CI checks pass, the branch can be merged without rebasing (because CI tools typically merge the master branch
to the PR before running checks).
. If the project does not have CI set up to run all tests,
. Checkout the branch PR to your Computer
. Run the tests and any other checks applicable (e.g. linters).
If any failed, use GitHub's Review feature to request changes.
. Merge using GitHub.
. If the commit history is clean (this should be the case for PRs done by experienced contributors who follow
the <<AdvancedContributorGuidelines.adoc#,advanced contributor guidelines>>),
Merge using the `Create a merge commit` option.
. Else, merge using the `Squash and merge` option.
. Optionally, apply an `e.*` label to the issue (not the PR) to indicate
the estimated effort required to fix the issue, and another `e.*` label to the PR
to indicate the estimated effort required to review the PR.
