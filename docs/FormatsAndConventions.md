# Formats and Conventions

## Branch

Format: **`issueNumber-some-keywords-from-issue-title`**

e.g. if the issue title is `Error alert email has very long subject #5958`, <br>
the branch name can be `5958-error-alert-long-subject`

Note: Use only _some_ (not _all_) keywords from the issue title (e.g. 3-5 keywords). Very long branch names 
are not desirable.

> Rationale: This format allows easy traceability between a branch and the issue it fixes. 
> It is particularly suitable for projects following a branch-per-issue workflow.

## Commit message

Every commit must have a well written commit message _**subject line**_.
 
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
   e.g. `Add README.md` rather than `Added README.md` or `Adding README.md`

Commit messages for non-trivial commits should have a _**body**_ giving details of the commit.
 
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain WHAT the commit is about and WHY it was done that way. The reader can refer to the diff to 
   understand HOW the change was done.
  
   * Give an explanation for the change(s) that is detailed enough so that the reader can judge if it is a
     good thing to do, without reading the actual diff to determine how well the code does what the explanation 
     promises to do.<br>
     If your description starts to get too long, that's a sign that you probably need to split up 
     your commit to finer grained pieces. [adapted from: [git project][git-commit-guide]]
   * Minimize in the commit message information that can be included in the code as comments. 

Stylistic recommendations:

* Follow this flow:

   ```
   {current situation} -- use present tense
   
   {why it needs to change}
   
   {what is being done about it} -- use imperative mood
   
   {why it is done that way}
   
   {any other relevant info}
   ```
   
* Use blank lines to separate paragraphs. 
* Avoid terms such as 'currently', 'originally' when describing the current situation. They are implied.
* The word `Let's` can be used to indicate the beginning of the section that describes the change done in the commit.

Here is an example commit message for a code quality refactoring:

```
Person attributes classes: extract parent class

Person attribute classes (e.g. Name, Address, Age etc.) has
some common behaviors (e.g. isValid()).

The common behavior across person attribute classes causes
code duplication.

Extracting the common behavior into a super class allows
us to use polymorphism when dealing with person attributes.
For example, validity checking can be done for all attributes
of a person in one loop.

Let's define a PersonAttribute class and make it the parent
class of person attribute classes. Pull up behaviors common
to all person attributes into the new parent class.

Using inheritance is preferable over composition in this
situation because the common behaviors are not composable.

Refer this S/O discussion on dealing with attributes
http:stackoverflow.com/some/question
```

An example commit message for a bug fix:

```
Find command: make matching case insensitive 

Find command is case sensitive.

A case insesitive find is more user friendly because users
cannot be expected to remember exact case of the key words.

Let's update the matching algorithm to use a case-insensitive
matching.

```
An example commit message for a commit that is part of a multi-commit PR:
```
Unify variations of toSet() methods

There are several methods that convert a collection to
a set. In some cases the conversion is inlined as a 
code block in another method.

Unifying all those duplicated code improves the code
quality.

As a step toward such unification, let's extract
inlined code blocks that converts collections to sets
into separate methods in the respective classes.
Doing so will make the subsequent unification easier.
```

advice on writing good commit messages.

## Commit organization

> _Ask a programmer to review 10 lines of code, he'll find 10 issues. Ask him to do 500 lines and he'll say it 
> looks good. [[source](https://twitter.com/girayozil/status/306836785739210752)]_

Commits of a PR should be organized to match the following requirements:

- [x] Each commit contains a single logical change, and this change must stand on its own. 
  i.e. each commit has a single responsibility, and that responsibility must be fully carried out.<br>
  For example, if the commit message says `Move delete() from Person class to Address class`, the commit cannot 
  contain the addition of `delete()` to `Address` class only; it should also contain the deletion of `delete()` from
  the `Person` class for it to be a _complete_ implementation what is stated in the commit message. <br>
  Furthermore, the series of commits in the PR are ordered in a bottom-up fashion, each commit building 
  on top of each other towards the end goal of the PR.
  
  > Rationale: Reviewers should be able to review one commit at a time.
  
- [x] A commit should not modify more than 100 lines of code. 
  
  > Rationale: Bigger commits make reviewing harder.

  Commits containing _**mechanical changes**_ (e.g. automated refactorings, cut-paste type code movements, 
  file renames, etc.),

    * should include only one _mechanical change_  per commit.
    * should not contain other non-mechanical changes, unless unavoidable.
    * can exceed 100 LoC.
    * should have the description of the change in the commit message (so that the results can be reproduced). 
  
- [x] The build passes at each commit of the PR.

  > Rationale: Build-breaking commits in the version history hinder the ability to use `git bisect` for locating bugs.

- [x] Each commit has a detailed commit message which explains the context and rationale behind the commit.

> [Here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/237) is an example of a PR that is organized 
> as described above.

<p>

> **Note for first time contributors**:
> 
> * PRs for `d.FirstTimers` issues are usually simple enough to be contained in one commit. 
  
## Directory

* If the project uses a framework that has a specific folder naming convention, follow that instead.
* Use lowerCamelCase (similar to java methods) whenever possible. e.g. `testData`
* Prefer plurals if the folder contains multiple items of same type e.g. `docs` instead of `doc`

## File

* If the project uses a framework that has a specific file naming convention, follow that instead.
* Use UpperCamelCase (similar to java class names) whenever possible. e.g. `FormatsAndConventions.md`
* If the file name has multiple phrases, use `-` to separate phrases. e.g. `CodingStyle-JavaBasic.html`
* Try to user common prefixes so that similar files appear together when sorted by name. 
  e.g. prefer `CodingStyle-JavaBasics.html` and `CodingStyle-HtmlBasics.html` to 
  `JavaCodingStyleBasics.html` and `HtmlCodingStyleBasics.html`
* For documents, try to make the file name match the document title as much as possible.

## Issue

* Issue title should be concise yet descriptive.<br>
  For example, instead of `Newbie question, please help`, use `How do I set up git to ignore test files?`

* The phrasing should match the main purpose of the issue.<br>
  For example, if it is a bug report, the issue title should sound like a bug report 
  (e.g `Option 'other' is missing from the dropdown`) instead of a feature request 
  (e.g. `Add 'other' option to the dropdown`).

## Merge commit

This format is only for commits merging a PR branch to `master` branch.

Format: **`[#IssueNumber] Issue Title (#PrNumber)`** <br>
e.g. `[#5958] Error alert email has very long subject (#6580)`

> Rationale: This format allows easy traceability among a merge commit, the issue it fixes, and the PR that fixed it. 
> Having the issue name tells us what the commit is about without having to look it up in GitHub issue tracker.

## PR

Format: **`IssueTitle #IssueNumber`** <br>
e.g. `Error alert email has very long subject #5958`

> Rationale: Duplicating issue title in PR title is for easy tracing between PRs and issues, 
> to compensate for GitHub's lack of strong linking between the two.
> Assume there is an invisible prefix in front of the PR title `Fixes issue : ...`

## Spelling

Use American English spelling.

> Rationale: Consistent spelling improves discoverability of API methods.
